More sessions for a longer period of time, like through out 6 months. 
a welcome meeting in person so you could introduce who the company is and you could meet the mentors and mentees
More networking events and maybe a few workshops!
I think having a list of prompts for the first session would have been a good icebreaker
I recommend establishing communication between mentees and recruiters, thereby enabling us to be considered for upcoming processes
Not really i felt it amazing
Perhaps for the future, the initial meeting could be held in person instead of it being online and helping as an "Ice Breaker"

More networking events
In person meetings 
Not necesarily 
Online Playbook could be helpful

Periodical online meeting with the Empower Latam community being part of the program\

No
I would say in the beginning check the enthusiasm of the mentors, as I know a girl who also applied to this programme and her experince with her mentor was different to mine
More workshops or webinars about professional skills to enhance our career
I was saddened that to some career talks I was unable to attend especially because I live in Bristol and I still had University to attend to. I really would have loved to attend a networking event
More topics to be covered 
It was an excellent for young professional trying to kick-start their careers in the UK. I had a great time on Google Uk as well.
